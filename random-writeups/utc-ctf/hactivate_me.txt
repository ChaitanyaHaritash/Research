Binary Information :

FileName         : rev.exe
ARCH             : I386
DotNET           : False
ASLR             : False
DEP              : False
Authenticode     : False
StrongNaming     : N/A
SafeSEH          : True
ControlFlowGuard : False
HighentropyVA    : False


Solution:

1; Patch on address "00402861" jne rev.402868 to je rev.402868 so binary will ask for username and key.
2; Set bp over GetSystemTime and press f8 to see key forming in eax. Remember, key will stay valid for an hour, else you got to get another key.
3; Patch, save the binary and re-open in debugger and enter correct username and key attained in previous steps. 
4; Patch on address "00401DF4" jne rev.4023EB to je rev.4023EB. so the execution flow can divert to WriteProcessMemory.
5; set breakpoint on WriteProcessMemory and keep check on 3rd parameter for flag.

flag : utc{r3v3rsing_1s_fUn}

I hope it wasn't that hard for a teaser ctf :)
